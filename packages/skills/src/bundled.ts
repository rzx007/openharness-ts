const COMMIT = `
# commit

Write a clean, conventional git commit for the staged (or specified) changes.

## When to use
After finishing a coherent unit of work and the user asks to commit, or you are
about to record changes. Prefer many small atomic commits over one large one.

## Method
1. Inspect what changed: \`git status\` and \`git diff --staged\` (or \`git diff\`).
   Understand the *intent* of the change, not just the lines.
2. Decide scope. One commit should represent one logical change. If the diff mixes
   unrelated concerns (a refactor + a bugfix), split them with \`git add -p\`.
3. Write the message as **Conventional Commits**:
   \`<type>(<scope>): <subject>\`
   - types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, build, ci
   - subject: imperative mood, lower-case, no trailing period, <= 72 chars
   - scope: optional, the affected area (e.g. \`auth\`, \`parser\`)
4. Add a body only when the *why* is non-obvious. Wrap at ~72 cols. Explain the
   motivation and contrast with previous behavior — not the *what* (the diff shows that).
5. Reference issues in a footer (\`Closes #123\`) when relevant.

## Good vs bad
- bad:  \`fix stuff\`
- good: \`fix(parser): handle empty frontmatter without throwing\`

## Checklist before committing
- [ ] Diff contains only related changes
- [ ] No debug prints, secrets, or commented-out code
- [ ] Subject is imperative and scoped
- [ ] Tests pass if the project has a fast test command
`;

const REVIEW = `
# review

Review a set of changes for correctness bugs first, then reuse/simplification.

## When to use
The user asks to review a diff, a PR, or the current working tree before merging.

## Method
1. Establish the diff under review: \`git diff\`, \`git diff main...HEAD\`, or the
   files the user named. Read enough surrounding code to understand intent.
2. **Pass 1 — correctness.** Hunt for real bugs, ranked by severity:
   - logic errors, off-by-one, wrong operator, inverted condition
   - unhandled errors, missing await, race conditions, resource leaks
   - boundary cases: empty input, null/undefined, large input, concurrency
   - security: injection, path traversal, unvalidated input, leaked secrets
3. **Pass 2 — reuse & simplification.** Only after correctness:
   - duplicated logic that an existing helper already covers
   - needless complexity that can be flattened
   - dead code, unused params, redundant branches
4. Skip style nits the formatter/linter already enforces.

## Output
Group findings by severity: **Critical / High / Medium / Low / Nit**.
For each: file:line, what's wrong, why it matters, and a concrete fix.
If the change is clean, say so plainly — do not invent problems to look thorough.
`;

const TEST = `
# test

Add or run tests that meaningfully cover the change.

## When to use
After (or while) implementing a feature/fix, or when the user asks for test coverage.

## Method
1. Find the project's test setup: framework, test command, and where tests live.
   Match the existing style and naming conventions.
2. Prefer **TDD** when adding new behavior: write a failing test that pins the
   desired behavior, watch it fail, implement, watch it pass.
3. Cover the **critical paths first**:
   - the happy path the feature exists for
   - the boundary/edge cases (empty, null, max, concurrent)
   - the error path (does it fail the way it should?)
   - one regression test per bug you fix
4. Keep tests deterministic and isolated — no real network, clocks, or shared
   mutable state. Mock at the boundary, not the internals.
5. **Run them** and read the output. A test you didn't run is a guess.

## Anti-patterns
- Asserting on implementation details instead of observable behavior.
- Tests that pass even when the code is broken (no real assertion).
- Giant tests covering ten things — one behavior per test.

## Finish
Report what is now covered and what is intentionally not, then run the suite.
`;

const PLAN = `
# plan

Turn a request into a concrete, executable implementation plan before coding.

## When to use
The task is multi-step or touches several files, and jumping straight to code
risks rework. Plan first, then execute.

## Method
1. **Clarify the goal.** Restate what done looks like in one or two sentences.
   Note any ambiguity worth confirming before writing code.
2. **Survey the code.** Identify the key files/modules involved and how they
   connect. Find the seam where the change belongs.
3. **Break into ordered steps.** Each step should be small, independently
   verifiable, and leave the build green if possible. Sequence so dependencies
   come first.
4. For each step note: the files touched, the core change, and how to verify it.
5. **Call out risks** up front: tricky edge cases, things that could break
   downstream, places you're unsure about and want to validate early.

## Output format
- **Goal:** one-line definition of done
- **Key files:** path — role in the change
- **Steps:** numbered, each with file(s) + verification
- **Risks / open questions:** what could go wrong, what to confirm

Keep it tight. A plan is a tool to act, not a document to admire.
`;

const DEBUG = `
# debug

Systematically find and fix the root cause of a bug — reproduce before you change.

## When to use
A test fails, behavior is wrong, or something throws. Use this *before* proposing
a fix, especially when the cause isn't obvious.

## Method
1. **Reproduce reliably.** Get a deterministic, minimal repro. If you can't
   reproduce it, you can't confirm a fix. Capture exact input, environment, and output.
2. **Read the actual error.** Full stack trace, real message — not a paraphrase.
   The failing frame usually points near the cause.
3. **Localize.** Bisect the problem space: which layer, which function, which input.
   Add targeted logging or use a debugger. Form a hypothesis you can test, then test it.
4. **Find the root cause, not the symptom.** Ask why the bad state arose, not just
   how to suppress it. A null check that hides a missing initialization is a patch, not a fix.
5. **Fix the cause.** Make the smallest change that addresses the root.
6. **Verify.** Re-run the original repro and confirm it now passes. Add a
   regression test so it can't silently come back. Check you didn't break neighbors.

## Discipline
- One hypothesis at a time. Don't shotgun multiple changes and lose track of cause.
- If a fix doesn't work, revert it before trying the next idea.
- Resist the urge to "fix" code you don't yet understand.
